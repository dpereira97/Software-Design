# Software-Design

Consisted in two projects.

The first project includes a java maven project called torngest4ds, a java EE application made by other students in the Software Systems Costruction course and was about making
a Software Architecture Document about that project and a sonarqube report as well.<br/>

The second project included a middleware API called bezirk and consisted in making a family of Software Products that used the bezirk api. Such projects included ambient monitors, wearable
devices, various types of output and a motion detector. Shoud note that none of this was implemented with actual devices, it was implemented instead with the command line in Java and 
the computer's webcam for motion detection and the activity monitor used an api that could actually talk as devices need to be made for blind, deaf and non-disabled people. Devices for
deaf people were supposed to use lights but we emulated that in the java console line. We also implemented an SMS sender as it was part of the system's requirments.

All further documentation for these projects are in Portuguese.
